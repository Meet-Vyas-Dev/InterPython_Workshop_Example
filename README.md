# Introduction

This is a fork of the template software project repository used by the [Intermediate Python for Astronomical Software Development](https://shrra.github.io/python-intermediate-development/index.html).

## Purpose

This repository contains my attemp at the Intermediate Python for Astronomical Software Course where I have updated the functions according to the exercises and added descriptions to the functions. 

The original repository is intended to be used as a code template which can be copied by learners at [Intermediate Python for Astronomical Software Development](https://shrra.github.io/python-intermediate-development/index.html) course.
This can be done using the `Fork` button towards the top right of this repo's GitHub page.

## Tests

The tests include checking the code for python version compatibility, os compatibility, checking for the requirements, and testing the code formatting with pytest, and finally checking the .py and .ipynb styles with pylint.
